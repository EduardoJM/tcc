	abstract = {Rayleigh's classical book Theory of Sound was first published in 1877. In it are many examples of calculating fundamental natural frequencies of free vibration of continuum systems (strings, bars, beams, membranes, plates) by assuming the mode shape, and setting the maximum values of potential and kinetic energy in a cycle of motion equal to each other. This procedure is well known as “Rayleigh's Method.” In 1908, Ritz laid out his famous method for determining frequencies and mode shapes, choosing multiple admissible displacement functions, and minimizing a functional involving both potential and kinetic energies. He then demonstrated it in detail in 1909 for the completely free square plate. In 1911, Rayleigh wrote a paper congratulating Ritz on his work, but stating that he himself had used Ritz's method in many places in his book and in another publication. Subsequently, hundreds of research articles and many books have appeared which use the method, some calling it the “Ritz method” and others the “Rayleigh–Ritz method.” The present article examines the method in detail, as Ritz presented it, and as Rayleigh claimed to have used it. It concludes that, although Rayleigh did solve a few problems which involved minimization of a frequency, these solutions were not by the straightforward, direct method presented by Ritz and used subsequently by others. Therefore, Rayleigh's name should not be attached to the method.}}
