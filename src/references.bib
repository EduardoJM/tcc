	abstract = {Rayleigh's classical book Theory of Sound was first published in 1877. In it are many examples of calculating fundamental natural frequencies of free vibration of continuum systems (strings, bars, beams, membranes, plates) by assuming the mode shape, and setting the maximum values of potential and kinetic energy in a cycle of motion equal to each other. This procedure is well known as “Rayleigh's Method.” In 1908, Ritz laid out his famous method for determining frequencies and mode shapes, choosing multiple admissible displacement functions, and minimizing a functional involving both potential and kinetic energies. He then demonstrated it in detail in 1909 for the completely free square plate. In 1911, Rayleigh wrote a paper congratulating Ritz on his work, but stating that he himself had used Ritz's method in many places in his book and in another publication. Subsequently, hundreds of research articles and many books have appeared which use the method, some calling it the “Ritz method” and others the “Rayleigh–Ritz method.” The present article examines the method in detail, as Ritz presented it, and as Rayleigh claimed to have used it. It concludes that, although Rayleigh did solve a few problems which involved minimization of a frequency, these solutions were not by the straightforward, direct method presented by Ritz and used subsequently by others. Therefore, Rayleigh's name should not be attached to the method.}}

	abstract = {This paper deals with the applicability of the Rayleigh–Ritz method for the determination of frequency coefficients of beams and plates with elastically restrained edges. Natural frequencies of beams elastically restrained against rotation and translation at both ends and of rectangular isotropic plates with elastic edge restraints are studied by using the Rayleigh–Ritz method along with orthogonal polynomials as co-ordinate functions. It is shown that the approximate satisfaction of boundary conditions introduces additional constraints into the formulation that bring unexpected values in the results. On the other hand, it is shown that there are defects in the approximations when the natural boundary conditions in beams are taken into account. The adequate procedure for constructing the co-ordinate functions to avoid numerical errors is presented.}}

	abstract = {Summary An extension of Rayleigh's principle, which also enables to determine the higher frequencies, is the Rayleigh-Ritz method. This chapter only shows how to apply the method. The Rayleigh-Ritz method is more commonly used in continuous systems where the maximum displacement f is expressed as the sum of a series of products of undetermined weighting coefficients and admissible displacement functions. The chapter illustrates the example of Rayleigh–Ritz approach by using dynamic analysis of a cantilever beam. This example shows that the Rayleigh–Ritz approach can also be used for static analysis. The chapter now modifies the problem and considers the vibration of a cantilever beam carrying a thin mass and partly restrained by a spring at a point. The mass and moment of inertia of the thin mass are m0 and I0, respectively. Some results for the natural frequencies of a cantilever obtained using a MATLAB code.}}
